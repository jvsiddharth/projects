1. Chaos Game: Implement the Chaos Game, a mathematical visualization technique that generates fractal patterns. Users can specify the number of vertices of a polygon, and the program iteratively selects a random vertex and moves towards it to create intricate fractal shapes.

2. Numerical Integration: Develop a program that performs numerical integration techniques such as the Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson's Rule. Users can input a function and integration limits, and the program calculates the approximate integral.

3. Projectile Motion Simulation: Create a simulation of projectile motion where users can input initial velocity, launch angle, and other parameters. The program should calculate and display the projectile's trajectory, maximum height, and range.

4. N-Body Simulation: Build a simulation of the gravitational interactions between multiple bodies. Users can input the masses, initial positions, and velocities of celestial bodies, and the program should simulate their motion over time using Newton's laws of gravitation.

5. Differential Equation Solver: Develop a program that solves ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerically. Users can input the differential equation and initial conditions, and the program should provide a numerical solution using methods like Euler's method or Runge-Kutta methods.

6. Fractal Generator: Create a program that generates fractal images such as the Mandelbrot Set or Julia Set. Users can specify the region of interest and zoom level, and the program should generate and display the fractal image.

7. Quantum Mechanical Particle in a Box: Implement a simulation of the quantum mechanical particle in a box experiment. Users can specify the size of the box and the particle's initial conditions, and the program should calculate and visualize the particle's wavefunction and energy levels.

8. Chaos Theory Visualization: Develop a program that visualizes chaos theory concepts such as the Logistic Map or the Henon Map. Users can input parameters, and the program should generate and display the chaotic behavior of the system.
